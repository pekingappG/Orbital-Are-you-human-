Project Title
Are You Human? – A Creative Game Based on Human vs. Machine Detection

1. Background
Human-vs-machine tests—commonly seen in CAPTCHAs or verification scenarios—are widely used to distinguish between automated bots and real human users. This project aims to turn the concept of “human verification” into a fun, interactive game experience. While primarily entertaining, the game also offers insight into the differences (and similarities) between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

2. Project Overview
Name: Are You Human?
Type: Casual Puzzle/Arcade Game
Target Platforms: Web (HTML5 / JavaScript / Phaser / Unity WebGL) or Mobile (Unity / Cocos Creator)
Core Mechanics: Players must complete a series of mini-challenges that leverage various human strengths—visual recognition, auditory analysis, language comprehension, and motor coordination—to prove they are not “robots.”
Project Goals:
Deliver a creative and engaging experience through multiple human-detection style levels.
Showcase and examine AI limitations in areas like vision, hearing, and language.
Provide team members with hands-on practice in game design, development, and testing.

3. Requirements and Objectives
Functional Requirements
Multi-Mode Challenges
Incorporate several test categories, such as:
Visual Recognition (e.g., spot-the-difference, object classification)
Auditory Tests (e.g., matching short audio clips, rhythm-based tapping)
Language Tasks (e.g., CAPTCHAs, dialogue comprehension)
Logical Reasoning (e.g., puzzle-solving, 9-square pattern logic)
Motor Skills (e.g., quick tap or swipe to avoid obstacles)
Clear Progression System
Levels or stages that gradually introduce complexity;
Score-based or performance-based feedback and progression.
Non-Functional Requirements
User Experience
Intuitive interface and clear on-screen instructions;
Ample hints or tutorials to guide new players.
Scalability
Ability to add more levels or test types in future updates;
Potential to localize content for different languages and regions.
Performance
Smooth gameplay with minimal load times or crashes on target devices/browsers.
Objectives and Metrics
Player Engagement: Aim for at least 5–10 minutes of continuous play before a user drops out.
Completion Rate: Ensure ~80% of new players can clear the first few levels, with progressive difficulty in later stages.
Development Goals: Empower the team to complete a functional prototype and refine it for a public release.

4. Game Design & Key Features
Example Levels


Level A: Spot the Difference
Players have limited time to identify all discrepancies in two nearly identical images.
Level B: Audio Matching
The game plays a short melody; players choose the matching audio sample from multiple options.
Level C: Text-Based CAPTCHAs
A distorted code or phrase appears; users must type in the correct characters.
Level D: Motor Skills / Reflex
Players navigate a character on-screen to dodge moving obstacles in real time.
Level E: Pattern Logic
A 3×3 puzzle with the final image missing; players must determine the correct piece that fits the pattern.
Scoring and Progress Tracking


Each success or failure affects the player’s overall score or rating.
Unlockable levels or linear progression system to maintain player interest.
User Interface & Interactions


Main Menu: Start Game, Continue, Leaderboards, Settings
Level Selection: Once unlocked, players can revisit or retry earlier levels.
Tutorial/Onboarding: Brief explanations for new mechanics.

5. Technical Approach & Tools
Game Engine (Choose One Based on Team Expertise)


HTML5 + Phaser for rapid web development
Unity for versatile, multi-platform deployment
